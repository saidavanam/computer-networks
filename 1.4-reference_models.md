Based on the content from "Computer Networks, Fifth Edition" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and David J. Wetherall, I have prepared detailed notes on the OSI and TCP/IP reference models, which are fundamental to understanding network architectures:

## 1.4 Reference Models 🌍💻

### **1.4.1 The OSI Reference Model**
- **Overview**: Developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO), the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven distinct layers【34†source】.
  
  - **Physical Layer**: Handles the transmission of raw bits over a communication channel, dealing with mechanical, electrical, and timing interfaces【35†source】.
  - **Data Link Layer**: Transforms a raw transmission facility into a line that appears free of undetected transmission errors, manages data frames, and controls data flow and error masking【36†source】.
  - **Network Layer**: Controls the operation of the subnet, managing packet routing, congestion, and quality of service. It also deals with interconnecting heterogeneous networks【37†source】.
  - **Transport Layer**: Provides efficient, end-to-end data transfer, isolating upper layers from hardware changes. It handles error-free, point-to-point message delivery【38†source】.
  - **Session Layer**: Facilitates communication sessions between users on different machines, including dialog control and synchronization【39†source】.
  - **Presentation Layer**: Concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information transmitted, managing data encoding and abstract data structures【40†source】.
  - **Application Layer**: Contains high-level protocols needed by users, like HTTP for web browsing, and protocols for file transfer and email【41†source】.

### **1.4.2 The TCP/IP Reference Model**
- **Origin**: Developed for ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet, the TCP/IP model was designed with robustness and flexibility, particularly for interconnecting multiple networks【42†source】.

  - **Link Layer**: Acts as an interface between hosts and transmission links, rather than a layer in the traditional sense【43†source】.
  - **Internet Layer**: Holds the architecture together, enabling hosts to inject packets into any network and managing packet travel across networks【44†source】.
  - **Transport Layer**: Similar to OSI, allows peer entities on source and destination hosts to carry on conversations, using protocols like TCP for reliable transmission and UDP for less reliable, connectionless services【45†source】.
  - **Application Layer**: Contains all higher-level protocols, like TELNET, FTP, and SMTP, and lacks session and presentation layers【46†source】.

### **Comparison of OSI and TCP/IP Models**
- **Similarities**: Both are based on a stack of independent protocols, with the transport layer providing an end-to-end transport service【47†source】.
- **Differences**:
  - **Layer Structure**: OSI has seven layers, TCP/IP has four.
  - **Communication Types**: OSI supports both connectionless and connection-oriented communication, while TCP/IP mainly supports connectionless at the network layer but both at the transport layer【47†source】.
  - **Focus**: OSI emphasizes the distinction between services, interfaces, and protocols, while TCP/IP focuses more on protocols, fitting them perfectly but not being as general as OSI for describing other networks【47†source】.
