## 1.6 Network Standardization üåê
### Overview
#### **Key Concepts**
- **Purpose of Standards**: Standards are essential for interoperability among different network systems, leading to a larger market and economies of scale.
- **Types of Standards**:
  - **De facto**: Standards that evolve naturally without formal planning, e.g., HTTP and Bluetooth.
  - **De jure**: Formally adopted standards by standardization bodies, e.g., ITU, ISO, IETF, and IEEE.

### 1.6.1 Who's Who in the Telecommunications World üìû
#### **Key Concepts**
- **International Telecommunication Union (ITU)**:
  - **Role**: Standardizes international telecommunication, including telephony and data communication.
  - **Structure**: Divided into ITU-T for standardization, ITU-R for radio frequencies, and ITU-D for ICT development.
  - **Impact**: Produces internationally recognized recommendations, like H.264 for video compression.

### 1.6.2 Who's Who in the International Standards World üåç
#### **Key Concepts**
- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**:
  - **Function**: Publishes a wide range of international standards, including those for telecommunications.
  - **Process**: Involves drafting, circulating for comments, revising, and finally approving standards through a consensus-driven approach.
  - **Collaboration**: Works closely with ITU-T to avoid conflicting standards.

### 1.6.3 Who's Who in the Internet Standards World üíª
#### **Key Concepts**
- **Internet Architecture Board (IAB)**:
  - **Role**: Oversees internet-related research and engineering efforts, including the development of standards.
  - **Methodology**: Utilizes a less formal process known as "rough consensus and running code."
- **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**:
  - **Function**: Focuses on short-term engineering issues, divided into various working groups for specific problems.
  - **Standardization Process**: Involves proposing, testing, and approving standards through rigorous community involvement and practical implementation.
- **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**:
  - **Purpose**: Develops protocols and guidelines for the Web's growth, led by Tim Berners-Lee.
  - **Achievements**: Influential in establishing key web standards like HTML.
