## 1.3 Network Software üåçüíª

### **1.3.1 Protocol Hierarchies**
- **Concept**: Networks are organized in layers, each building upon the one below it. This structure reduces design complexity and allows each layer to offer services to higher layers while hiding the details of implementation„Äê23‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Protocols**: Each layer follows a set of rules, known as protocols, which are agreements on how communication proceeds between the same layer on different machines„Äê23‚Ä†source„Äë.

### **1.3.2 Network Architecture**
- **Definition**: A set of layers and protocols is known as network architecture. The architecture must have enough information to allow implementation of each layer according to its protocol„Äê24‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Protocol Stack**: A list of protocols used by a system, one for each layer, is referred to as a protocol stack„Äê24‚Ä†source„Äë.

### **Key Design Issues**
- **Reliability**: Ensuring the network operates correctly despite unreliable components. Strategies include error detection and correction codes, and routing to find working paths through the network„Äê25‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Network Evolution**: Supporting network growth and new designs through protocol layering and addressing/naming mechanisms„Äê25‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring designs work well as networks grow large„Äê25‚Ä†source„Äë.
- **Resource Allocation**: Dividing network resources to prevent interference between hosts„Äê25‚Ä†source„Äë.

### **Service Types**
- **Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless Service**:
  - **Connection-Oriented**: Similar to a telephone system; establishes a connection, uses it, then releases it. Ensures the order of bits and can negotiate parameters like message size and quality of service„Äê26‚Ä†source„Äë.
  - **Connectionless**: Modeled after the postal system; each message is routed independently. Includes store-and-forward and cut-through switching. Can be reliable or unreliable, and suitable for various applications like file transfer, voice over IP, or electronic junk mail„Äê26‚Ä†source„Äë.

### **Services vs. Protocols**
- **Distinction**: Services are operations a layer provides to the layer above it, defining what operations it can perform. Protocols, however, are the rules for the format and meaning of messages exchanged within a layer. This distinction is crucial in network design, emphasizing the separation of service interfaces and protocol implementations„Äê27‚Ä†source„Äë.
