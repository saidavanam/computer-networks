## 1.2 Network Hardware üñ•Ô∏è

### **1.2.1 Personal Area Networks (PANs)** üì±
- **Definition & Examples**: PANs enable communication over a short range around a person, often using wireless technology like Bluetooth. Examples include connecting a computer to peripherals like a keyboard and mouse, or a mobile phone to a headset.
- **Technologies**: Besides Bluetooth, technologies like RFID are used in PANs for applications like smartcards.

### **1.2.2 Local Area Networks (LANs)** üè†
- **Definition & Importance**: LANs are networks within a small geographical area like a home, office, or campus. They are crucial for sharing resources and data transfer.
- **Types**: 
  - **Wired LANs**: Use cables, often copper or optical fiber, with technologies like Ethernet. Faster and more reliable than wireless LANs.
  - **Wireless LANs (WLANs)**: Use radio waves, with technologies like Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11). Popular due to ease of installation.
- **Performance**: Wired LANs generally offer better performance compared to WLANs in terms of speed, delay, and error rates.

### **1.2.3 Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)** üåÜ
- **Definition & Scope**: MANs cover larger areas than LANs, typically a city. Examples include cable TV networks.
- **Evolution & Use**: Originally for TV reception, these networks have evolved to provide two-way Internet services.

### **1.2.4 Wide Area Networks (WANs)** üåç
- **Definition & Scale**: WANs span large geographical areas, such as countries or continents.
- **Components**: Consist of transmission lines (copper, fiber, radio links) and switches or routers.
- **Subnets**: In WANs, the collection of routers and communication lines is known as a subnet.
- **Types**:
  - **Wired WANs**: Use leased transmission lines.
  - **Wireless WANs**: Include satellite systems and cellular networks.
  - **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**: Use the Internet to connect different sites.

### **1.2.5 Internetworks** üåê
- **Definition & Examples**: Internetworks or internets are collections of interconnected networks, using various technologies and protocols. The global Internet is a prime example.
- **Formation & Importance**: Formed by connecting different types of networks, internetworks facilitate global communication and data exchange.
