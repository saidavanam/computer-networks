## 1.5 Example Networks üåê
### 1.5.1 The Internet üåç
#### **Key Concepts**
- **Definition**: The Internet is a vast collection of different networks, using common protocols and services. It is unique as it was not planned or controlled by any single entity.
- **Origin**: Its roots trace back to the **ARPANET** in the late 1950s, created by the U.S. Department of Defense for a robust command-and-control network.
- **ARPANET**: Developed with packet-switching technology for fault tolerance and reliability. This system evolved into what we know today as the Internet.
- **Growth**: Rapid expansion and integration of varied technological frameworks, forming a complex global network.

### 1.5.4 RFID and Sensor Networks üè∑Ô∏è
#### **Key Concepts**
- **RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification)**:
  - **Usage**: In objects for tracking and identification. Common in everyday items like books, passports, and shipping pallets.
  - **Technology**: Consists of a microchip and an antenna, powered by radio waves from RFID readers (passive RFID).
  - **Applications**: In supply chain management, identity verification, and replacing traditional barcodes.
- **Sensor Networks**: Extend the concept of networking to the physical world, enabling the monitoring and data collection from various environments.
